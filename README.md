# CustomTiler
> Status: Under development ⚠️

CustomTiler is a simple tool I made to keep my desktop organized. It's a window tiling manager that automatically arranges your open windows into a neat grid so that everything fits perfectly on your screen without overlapping. I built it using C and Windows libraries, and I'm using it myself to make my life a bit easier when I'm working with lots of windows open at the same time.

# Purpose
It's just for my personal use to help keep my desktop tidy and my workflow smooth.
